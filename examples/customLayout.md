# Confirming Analysis

Data Analysis is often used to make educated guesses based on sample data. 

We might look at the Animals Dataset and try to draw conclusions about other animal shelters based on that sample. 

But if the sample doesn’t accurately represent the full population, those conclusions can be wrong —and sometimes, really, really wrong!

# Confirming Analysis

Testing Tables can also be used to *verify that a certain analysis is correct*. 

Code that filters a table to show only cats can’t be verified with a Testing Table that _already_ has only cats. (Why not?)

Code that shows only the kittens..._sorted in ascending order by weight_ must be verified by a Table containing cats, non-cats, old and young cats..._and_ rows that aren’t already sorted!

# Slides can use custom master slides

Complex analysis has more room for mistakes, so it’s critical to think about a Testing Table that allows us to trust that our code really does what it’s supposed to!

*How would you check whether or not a facial recognition system was equally accurate for everyone?*

# Slides can use custom master slides

Custom master slides can be selected by adding the attribute `{layout="Title and body"}`, rather than auto detect the layout 
the slide layout will be chosen from the available master slides by the name.

This can be used with the flag `--copy=[presentation id]` to copy and use an existing presentation as the source rather than a blank slide.
